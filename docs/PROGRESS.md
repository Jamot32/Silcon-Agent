# Progress

M0 — PASS: Compose starts Next.js + FastAPI; real SQLite health and honest empty demo shell.
Check — `make dev`: API Healthy / web Healthy; `curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/api/health`: JSON (database ok, EDA not_verified, LLM not_configured); `make test`: 1 passed, tsc passed; frontend production build passed.
Next — M1: execute the golden counter through pinned Docker EDA. Model smoke is blocked by missing META_API_KEY; no API request made.

M1 — PASS: real golden counter through Verilator → 4 cocotb tests/Icarus → Yosys → full LibreLane sky130 flow → readable GDS and KLayout PNG, with DRC/LVS/XOR clean.
Check — `make eda-setup` passed; final `make eda-check`: `[flow] PASS (48.3s)` and `[artifacts] PASS: readable GDS, PNG, LEF, netlist, metrics; DRC/LVS/XOR clean`; 17 committed fixtures match original bytes and SHA256 provenance. `make demo` and `make test` passed (2 pytest checks + tsc).
Next — M2: build parsers from the discovered real keys and reports. M3's live Muse Spark acceptance needs META_API_KEY in .env; smoke currently exits 2 without making a request. Agent, bundles, and replay remain later milestones.
